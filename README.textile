h1. UI

* Goban (table + css for stones)
* Panel for interface

h1. Communication

* Connecting with another player
* Stone placement: 
##place stone,
##check for legality,
##check for consequences (captured stones), 
##update game state, 
##refresh boards
*Enable back and forth comments during game
*Output game record as .sgf file
*Endgame: calculate score, declare winner

p. Some of these -- certainly score calculation, even checking for legality -- we may want to put off to secondary phases. These tasks could just be left up to the human player for the initial phase.
